        <p class="textul">FC Barcelona, founded in 1899 by a group of young foreigners living in Barcelona,
            was
            the
            result of the increasing popularity of football, and other British sports, across Europe. These origins have
            conferred upon the Club its intercultural identity, multi-sport focus and its deeply-rooted allegiance to
            Barcelona and Catalonia. The foundation of the Club coincided with a time when people were becoming
            interested
            in playing sport in Catalonia; this social context and Catalonia’s idiosyncratic culture led to the creation
            of
            a new model of modern leisure. Gamper, the Club’s founder, was the inspiration and driving force behind the
            Club’s first 25 years. His commitment to FC Barcelona went far beyond his role as player, director and
            president.</p>

    <div class="patru">
        <p class="textul">In 1969, Agustí Montal Costa won the elections and became president of the Club.
            His programme insisted on member involvement, and was committed to the idea that all members would see their
            opinions reflected through their votes. In 1973, Montal was re-elected president despite only the members'
            representatives being able to vote.
            The outbreak of corruption associated with foreign players who falsified birth certificates in order to
            claim Spanish heritage and be admitted into Spanish football meant that it became possible to sign foreign
            players. Barça’s dream of signing Johan Cruyff began to look like a reality.</p>

        <p class="cincitext">From the season 2008/09 under Josep Guardiola, the team improved even further. Playing with
            the same style that Cruyff had introduced, Guardiola was a firm supporter of basing his team around the
            club's own youth system and promoted several young talents to the first team, and the result was the
            greatest Barça team ever.
            This team was the culmination of everything that FC Barcelona stands for, and produced an amazing string of
            major titles, including two Champions Leagues and three Spanish Leagues, plus the long-awaited Clubs World
            Cup, which was finally won in 2009, that extraordinary year when Barcelona won all six major trophies,
            something unprecedented in the history of European football. Barça broke all kinds of records, played
            memorable matches and won just about every title on offer. But the finest hour for Guardiola's side came at
            Wembley on 28 May, 2011, when the world was enchanted by the kind of football that dreams are made of. The
            world's press bestowed praise on this extraordinary side that had written one of the most incredible
            chapters in the history of the game. The Guardiola era ended in 2012 but Barça continued their success under
            Tito Vilanova (the league in 2012/13) and Luis Enrique who in 2015 won the Champions League, the League and
            the Copa del Rey in another historic treble winning season.
            The greatest international recognition of this came when the FIFA Ballon d'Or nominations in 2010
            shortlisted Xavi, Iniesta and Messi for the honour, all three of whom had grown up at La Masia, the
            residence where young sportspeople of all ages are trained and educated.</p>
